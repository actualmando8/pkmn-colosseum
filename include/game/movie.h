/**
 * @file movie.h
 * @brief THP movie playback system for Pokemon Colosseum.
 *
 * The movie system handles playback of THP (Nintendo's video format) files
 * for opening cinematics, logo screens, credits, auto-demo sequences, etc.
 *
 * THP files referenced in rodata:
 *   "movie/openingdemo.thp"  -- Opening cinematic
 *   "movie/staffroll.thp"    -- Credits / staff roll
 *   "movie/autodemo01.thp"   -- Auto-demo / attract mode
 *   "movie/gs_logo.thp"      -- Genius Sonority logo
 *   "movie/tpc.thp"          -- The Pokemon Company logo
 *
 * The movie playback functions sit in the early game code at approximately
 * 0x80035E04 - 0x800366D0. They call into the THP player library
 * (fn_801E1874 for THPPlayerGetState, fn_801E189C for THPPlayerOpen, etc.)
 * and coordinate with the sound system (fn_80165A20) and flag system
 * (fn_801902E0, fn_80190528) for proper sequencing.
 *
 * fn_80035E04, fn_80035EE4, fn_80035F34, and fn_80035F64 are the real,
 * address/size-confirmed movie stop/cleanup, opening-demo, auto-demo, and
 * staff-roll functions (defined directly in movie.c under those fn_ names,
 * matching config/GC6E01/symbols.txt); nothing else in the tree calls them
 * yet, so no prototypes are declared here. A prior campaign transplant's
 * invented movieWaitForFinish/moviePlayGSLogo/moviePlayTPCLogo helpers had
 * no real callers and have been removed.
 *
 * Address range: 0x80035E04 - 0x800366D0 (approx.)
